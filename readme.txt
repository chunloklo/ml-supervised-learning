Create a folder named data, npData, and objData
Obtain the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope
put magic04.data under data/

Obtain the Cover type data set from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset
put covtype.csv under data/forest/

For MAGIC Gamma Telescope data set results: run MAGICGammaTelescope.ipynb

For Cover Type data set results, run:
CovType-KNNTest.ipynb for KNN results
COVTypeNNTest.ipynb for neural network results
CovType.ipynb for the rest of the results
