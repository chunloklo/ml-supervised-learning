#we need
#decision trees
#neural networks - sklearn/keras?
#boosting
#SVM - sklearn
#k-nearest neighbor - sklearn


#testing pipeline:
#import data
#clean data
#separate into train test sets. Split into validation sets
#testing models: training and testing error rates
#graphs -> training and test data performance in terms of training size
#iterative -> training times/iteration (learning curves)


import sklearn
